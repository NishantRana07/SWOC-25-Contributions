## 🚀 Introduction

My journey began with contributing to the **Dev Display** project, where I added my profile in the project - [PR 696](https://github.com/codeaashu/DevDisplay/pull/696).

At that time, I was studying **Design and Analysis of Algorithms** (DSA) in college, which led me to contribute to the [**DSA Project**](https://github.com/PRIYESHSINGH24/SMART_DSA_NOTEBOOK). Over time, I made **35+ DSA PRs** and **5+ Development PRs**.
